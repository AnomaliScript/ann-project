# ANN Project
Hello, my name is Brandon, an aspiring AI/ML engineer; I made this repo to document my (mini) learning journey on how to use libraries like keras and numpy to prodict the strength of concrete (dataset is open-source I'm pretty sure)

## Usage
This ANN model can't really be used directly, but feel free to download the code and optimize it :)
